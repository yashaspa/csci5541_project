    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
    <p>College students often struggle with managing their academic workload due to a lack of structure and unoptimized time allocation. Our project, Automated School Planner, integrates a large language model (LLM) with existing academic tools like Canvas to provide a personalized, adaptive scheduling solution. By considering task descriptions, difficulty, and deadlines, we aim to provide a proactive and realistic time management tool that reduces stress and maximizes productivity, enabling students to maintain a balanced academic life.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="teaser">Teaser Figure</h2>
    <p>Our teaser figure conveys the core concept of our project: integrating LLMs with student data to provide personalized scheduling. This visual representation showcases the flow from data retrieval, analysis, and the generation of a schedule for the student. This concept addresses the critical issue of effective academic time management. Below is an example to highlight the automated school planner's application.</p>
    <p class="sys-img"><img src="./files/teeaser.png" alt="Teaser Image"></p>

    <h3 id="the-timeline-and-the-highlights">Explanation</h3>
    <p>The teaser figure illustrates the sequence of data processing: starting with integration from Canvas, feeding into the LLM for time estimation, and utilizing feedback to enhance future scheduling. This effectively visualizes how our planner iterates over time, improving its accuracy and personalization capabilities.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="introduction">Motivation and Problem Formulation</h2>
    <p><b>Motivation:</b> Many college students face challenges managing their schedules. Unstructured time management leads to missed deadlines, imbalanced workloads, and increased stress. Our Automated School Planner seeks to offer a structured solution that allows students to balance their academic responsibilities effectively by using advanced AI to intelligently allocate time for tasks.</p>
    <p><b>Problem Definition:</b> The lack of intelligent and adaptive tools to help students schedule their academic workload often results in suboptimal productivity. Current tools either require manual updates or lack personalization, leading to inefficiency. By creating a smart school planner that integrates LLM-based task allocation and user feedback mechanisms, we aim to address these inefficiencies and optimize students' workflow.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="approach">Proposed Ideas and Approach</h2>
    <p><b>Automated Task Scheduler with LLM Integration:</b> Our approach involves leveraging a large language model to estimate task durations based on assignment descriptions. The LLM will analyze the complexity of each assignment and suggest appropriate time allocations, providing a more realistic and customized schedule for students. This is crucial for students juggling multiple courses and deadlines.</p>
    <p><b>Canvas API Integration:</b> To make the process seamless for students, we integrated with Canvas using its API to fetch assignments, deadlines, and course details automatically. This saves time and ensures up-to-date information is always used for scheduling.</p>
    <p><b>Personalization Through Feedback:</b> User feedback is central to our planner. If a student completes a task in less time than suggested, the system will adapt and adjust future estimates accordingly. The feedback mechanism ensures that time estimates become more precise over repeated use, reflecting the individual learning pace and habits of each student.</p>
    <p><b>Google Calendar Support:</b> To enhance usability, our system allows students to manage their schedules on our platform or export them to Google Calendar, allowing them to integrate their academic commitments with their personal schedules seamlessly.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2 id="literature-review">Literature Review</h2>
    <p>Our research drew insights from various fields, including Automated Planning (AP), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and personalized learning systems. Automated Planning, commonly used in robotics, inspired our approach to action synthesis for achieving high-level goalsâ€”akin to achieving successful task completion for students. We also studied "Automated Educative Nudges," which demonstrated that integrating third-party services with Canvas is feasible, and inspired our API-driven solution. Additionally, research on information extraction using NLP provided foundational methods for analyzing assignment descriptions to gauge task complexity effectively.</p>

    <h2 id="novelty">Novelty of the Approach</h2>
    <p><b>Unique LLM Utilization:</b> Unlike existing planners, which are mostly rule-based and rigid, our planner leverages an LLM to dynamically infer task duration from assignment details. This allows for more nuanced predictions that consider the content and type of each assignment.</p>
    <p><b>Canvas Integration:</b> Current tools require students to input their schedules manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Our automated integration with Canvas provides a seamless experience that keeps schedules updated without any manual input, which is a unique feature in academic planners.</p>
    <p><b>User-Centric Adaptation:</b> Through continuous learning from user feedback, the system improves its accuracy over time. This feedback loop ensures that the planner adapts to each student, offering a truly personalized experience unlike standard static scheduling tools.</p>

    <h2 id="results">Preliminary Results</h2>
    <p><b>Baseline Comparison:</b> To evaluate our LLM-based approach, we established a rule-based baseline system for comparison. The rule-based system takes into account various parameters such as assignment length, course level (to estimate task difficulty), and type of assignment (e.g., essays versus problem sets). By factoring in these details, our baseline provides a reference point for evaluating the LLM's predictive capabilities. Initial testing showed significant improvements in estimation accuracy using LLM, especially for complex assignments.</p>
    <p><b>LLM-Based Predictions:</b> Our LLM-based predictions performed well in preliminary evaluations, especially with assignments that required multiple steps. The LLM could accurately interpret nuanced details in task descriptions, providing better time estimates than rule-based methods. This result highlights the power of NLP for detailed and context-specific analysis.</p>
    <p><b>User Feedback Loop:</b> The feedback mechanism is crucial for fine-tuning our predictions. In early tests, feedback data allowed the planner to adjust its subsequent estimates for similar assignments, resulting in greater accuracy and improved user satisfaction. The more a student interacts with the planner, the more tailored and effective the predictions become.</p>
    
    <h3 id="excalidraw">Project Planning Visualization</h3>

    <h3 id="llm-testing">LLM Testing and Evaluation</h3>
    <p>We conducted multiple experiments with different LLMs to determine the best-performing model for our use case. The evaluations considered prompt effectiveness, accuracy of estimated times, and ease of integration into our system. For more details on the testing process and results, please refer to the Google Sheet available <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16YQvsw9wDGDMGDVlJIs0UmcJAK4X_ZpI4utdu6fOXWA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion and Future Work</h2>
    <p><b>Further Exploration:</b> Moving forward, we plan to refine the LLM-based time estimation with more comprehensive metrics, such as historical student performance and specific subject complexities. Additionally, we aim to introduce temporal planning features, like identifying critical path activities and suggesting optimal work sequences to maximize productivity.</p>
    <p><b>Feedback Response and Mentor Insights:</b> Based on mentor feedback, our future work will focus on deepening the LLMâ€™s role in estimating time durations, particularly through the integration of quantitative measurements to enhance evaluation accuracy. This involves a more sophisticated approach to compare our LLM-driven system against the rule-based baseline and ensure transparency and accountability in its performance.</p>
    <p><b>Limitations and Potential Risks:</b> Currently, the model may not generalize well for highly specialized assignments that require domain-specific knowledge. We recognize this limitation and plan to incorporate additional training on niche subject areas. We are also exploring ethical considerations around dependency on automated scheduling and its effect on student decision-making, ensuring that our solution empowers rather than diminishes studentsâ€™ planning skills.</p>
